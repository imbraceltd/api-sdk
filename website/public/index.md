# Imbrace SDK

> Official TypeScript and Python SDKs for the Imbrace Gateway — type-safe, batteries-included, production-ready.

## Why Imbrace SDK?

  ### Type-safe by Design

Full TypeScript definitions and Python type hints across all 27+ resource
    namespaces. Catch errors at compile time, not runtime.

  ### Auto-retry & Resilience

Built-in exponential backoff for 429 and 5xx responses. Zero configuration
    needed — your app stays alive under load.

  ### 3-Tier Authentication

API Key, JWT Bearer, and legacy access token — all handled transparently.
    Switch auth strategy without changing business logic.

  ### Async-first Python

Parallel `AsyncImbraceClient` alongside the sync client. Drop into FastAPI,
    asyncio, or Django with one import.

## Quick Install

  
    
      TypeScript
    

    ```bash
    npm install @imbrace/sdk
    ```

    ```ts
    import { ImbraceClient } from "@imbrace/sdk";
    const client = new ImbraceClient();
    const me = await client.platform.getMe();
    ```

  
  
    
      Python
    

    ```bash
    pip install imbrace
    ```

    ```python
    from imbrace import ImbraceClient
    client = ImbraceClient()
    me = client.platform.get_me()
    ```
